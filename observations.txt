By plotting the Zipf's law for all the 13 scripts, I got the following observations:

Scripts 5, 8 and 10 don't follow the Zipf's law at all, and this can be our first inference regarding the scripts.
All the other scripts tend to follow the Zipf's distribution, but we will need some other metric to verify the validity of the remaining 10 scripts.
